### **The Watermark App** is a quick way to add text, photo, and shape-based watermarks to a group of photos. It was originally designed to help social media folks quickly watermark their photos.

**The Watermark App** is built using .NET Core 3.1 and WPF. It uses the [MIQM Fork of the WPF Extended Toolkit](https://github.com/miqm/wpftoolkit) as that one is licensed under MS-PL.

**The Watermark App** also uses the *awesome* [SixLabors.ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) library!
